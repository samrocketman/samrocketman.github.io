<h1>Content Header</h1>
<p>
	Content goes here. Welcome to web template 1.0. Amount of time taken to create this template was about 20 minutes.
</p>
<h2>Sub header</h2>
<p>
	This is where smaller sections of the main header go.
</p>
<h1>Idea behind the template</h1>
<p>
	I wanted you to have a professional way of displaying information. Your teacher wants a simple website and is more worried about content so I feel this design is the best way to achieve that.
</p>
<h1>Graphic Logo</h1>
<p>
	If you like that graphic logo with the mirrored text then I can make one for you.  Just let me know what the text is supposed to be and I will email the graphic back. I have also provided you a GIMP source file (located in <a href="images/web_temp_logo.xcf">images/web_temp_logo.xcf</a>) which you can use for yourself if you are comfortable with the GIMP.
</p>
<h1>Technologies used</h1>
<p>
	There are a few pieces of software I used to make this small/simple template.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/aptana/studio3/releases">Aptana Studio</a>. That was the environment that I programmed and formatted the code.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a> which was used for all the image and graphic creation.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	It is up to you as to whether or not you want to use this template. I merely wanted to give you an option. This was created with free and open source software which is available for any platform including but not limited to Linux, MAC, and Windows.
