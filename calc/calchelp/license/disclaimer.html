	<h2 style="color: red;">Warning!</h2>
	<p>I do my best to make sure all the calculations and conversions are accurate and correct. But there is  always the possibility that they are still inaccurate or incorrect. Here are some points I would like to bring to your attention.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Do not assume</b> any calculation/conversion this calculator makes is accurate and correct.</li>
		<li><b>Do not use</b> the Scientific Calculator where loss of life, money, or property could  result from inaccurate or incorrect conversions and/or calculations.</li>
		<li><b>Rounding Errors:</b> Often times, converting/calculating between large and small units causes rounding errors. <ol style="list-style:none"><li><i>Rounding errors are cause by  different:</i> browser types (even separate versions of the same type), operating systems, versions of JavaScript, and other factors. For example, you will sometimes see  999.9999999 or 1000.0000001 instead of 1000.<br><b>Example Equation:</b><br>1.001*(10^3)=1000.9999999999999 instead of 1001</li></ol></li>
	</ol>
	<p>Please keep these key points in mind when using this Scientific Calculator.<br>
	A quick tip would be, in the edit menu, to set float=10 and round your answers.  This will help reduce the rounding error effect.</p>
