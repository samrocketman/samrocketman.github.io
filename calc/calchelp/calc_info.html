	<p><b>What is the Scientific Calculator v1.3.4?</b></p>
	
	<p>It is an advanced calculator that uses JavaScript (not Java) to compute advanced math functions.Type in almost any equation and my calculator can handle it!</p>
	
	<p><b>Why is the version 1.x.x?</b></p>
	
	<p>That is the number of times the calculator has been majorly revised since its original release November, 2005. 2.x.x will be the version when the calculator has had 100 revisions.  Each revision usually contains 3 or more changes to the programming, ui, or documentation.</p>
	
	<p><b>Other Fun Facts:</b></p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>It took me 10 hours to make the initial design of the calculator.So when I mean it was created on November 28th, 2005.I litterally mean it was created that day!</li>
		<li>The original calculator had the following menus:</li>
		<li style="list-style: none">
			<ul>
				<li><i>File &gt; Exit</i></li>
				<li><i>Edit &gt; Copy</i></li>
				<li><i>Edit &gt; Paste</i></li>
				<li><i>Conv &gt; Bin &gt; Dec</i></li>
				<li><i>Conv &gt; Bin &gt; Hex</i></li>
				<li><i>Conv &gt; Dec &gt; Bin</i></li>
				<li><i>Conv &gt; Dec &gt; Hex</i></li>
				<li><i>Conv &gt; Hex &gt; Bin</i></li>
				<li><i>Conv &gt; Hex &gt; Dec</i></li>
				<li><i>View &gt; Standard</i></li>
				<li><i>View &gt; Scientific</i> (disabled)</li>
				<li><i>Help &gt; Help</i> (disabled)</li>
				<li><i>Help &gt; About Calculator</i></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The original calculator had most of the current buttons as well</li>
		<li>The original calculator only supported Internet Explorer.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>What changes have there been?</b></p>
	
	<p>All code has been entirely rewritten over versions 1.0.x and 1.1.x. It was rewritten to be better optimized, more efficient, and it was even reformatted to a common human readable tabular format across all documents. Even the file structure of the calculator has been changed. More menus have been added such as an Octal conversion and Temperature conversion in the <i>Conv</i> menu.  In version 1.3.3 Scientific Calculator saw another complete rewrite.  The method for grabbing and interpreting keystrokes was rewritten to be more compatible with IE8+.  The math interpreter, error checking, base converter, float rounding, and all math functions were taken out of the calculator and placed within a single JavaScript object.  This way any web application can benefit from the advanced interpreting, error checking, and calculating just like the Scientific Calculator.  This object is now a download option on my sourceforge project labeled <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/webtechtools/files/" target="_blank"> JavaScript Human Readable Math Library/Compute Object</a>.</p>
	
	<p><b>Future Plans?</b></p>
	
	<p>Eventually I want the calculator to be able to calculate in hexadecimal, octal, and binary modes.  And give the user the option to possibly automatically clean up equation errors.  Possibly saving settings within cookies?</p>
