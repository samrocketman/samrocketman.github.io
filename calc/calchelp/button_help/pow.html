	<p>Now we discuss power functions. Look at the picture below for a list of the power function buttons:</p>

	<p><b>Modulo Operator</b></p>
	<p>The modulo operator (also called the percent operator or %) divides the number on the left of the operator by the number on the right and the result is the remainder.</p>
	<p>Take 5/3 for example.  Three goes into five one time with a remainder of two.  So 5%3 = 2.</p>
	<p>Take 12/4 for example.  Four goes into twelve three times with a remainder of zero.  So 12%4 = 0.</p>
	
	<p><b>Examples of &quot;x^y&quot; functions:</b></p>
	<p>The power function is the <span style="color:red">x^y</span> button. Some may get confused as to how this works because when they click it what appears in the Display is &quot;^&quot; without quotes. This is actually just an easy way for you to write an equation and a feature not common to JavaScript based calculators.</p>

	<p>x^y is the same thing as X<sup>Y</sup>.<br>2<sup>3</sup>=8 is the same as 2^3=8<br>Putting it in a more complex equation is no problem either:<br>4(2<sup>3</sup>+4)=48 which is like 4*(2^3+4)</p>
	
	<p>To take the root of an equation remember that the exponent must be a fraction.  Square root would be x^(1/2), cube root would be x^(1/3), and so on.</p>

	<p><em>Don't forget the a symbol goes between 2 algebraic functions like (8)*(8)<br>Also all parenthesis have to be closed in order for any function to work</em></p>

	<p><b>Bitwise Operations</b></p>

	<p>There are two shift operations.  Shift left (x&lt;&lt;y) and shift right (x&gt;&gt;y).  Essentially this is the same thing as multiplying or dividing the x by 2<sup>y</sup></p>
	
	<p>For example 5&lt;&lt;2 is the same as 5*2^2 = 20.  In binary it would be 00101&lt;&lt;2 = 10100 which is 20.  The same can be said for 20&gt;&gt;2 which is 20/(2^2).  In binary it would be 10100&gt;&gt;2 = 00101 which is 5.</p>
